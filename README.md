# DialogueSystem

A modified dialogue system for Godot 4 inspired by [this tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CxA7o8ouyHM).  
Unlike the original fixed-screen implementation, this version dynamically positions dialogue boxes relative to the player (or another target node), making it suitable for free-roam games.

## Features

- Dialogue boxes that follow a target (e.g., player character).  
- Supports multiline dialogue with typewriter effect.  
- Works with free-roam or top-down games.  
- Easy to extend for branching dialogue or NPC interactions.  

---

## Installation

Clone the repository into your Godot project:

```bash
cd ~/GodotProjects/MyGame/addons
git clone https://github.com/<your-username>/godot_dynamic_dialogue.git
```

In Godot, enable the addon if placed in addons/. Otherwise, copy the scripts and scenes into your project.

---

## Usage

Attach the provided DialogueManager.gd script and scene to your game. Example:
```bash
var dialogue_manager = preload("res://addons/godot_dynamic_dialogue/DialogueManager.tscn").instantiate()
add_child(dialogue_manager)

dialogue_manager.show_dialogue("Hello, world!", $Player)
```
- The second argument is the node the dialogue should follow (e.g., $Player).
- If omitted, dialogue defaults to screen-fixed.

---

## Customization
You can modify:

- Fonts & Themes: Edit the Label/RichTextLabel style in the scene.
- Box Positioning: Adjust offsets relative to the target.
- Typing Speed: Configurable variable in the script.
- Branching Logic: Extend with choice prompts.
